# MidiPlayer
Midi Playback audio plugin

## History 
This plugin started as a collaboration with someone who made a post on the JUCE forum. They were looking for a developer to provide a quote and build the plugin for them. I told him my going rate and asked if he had a budget. He ignored the question and asked if I would be willing to work as a partner. I gave him an extremely low quote which he agreed to. Based on his description of the plugin, I wrote up a SOW document. Over a short period of time, I completed a MVP and sent him a demo video. He was happy with my work but no payment yet. I sent him a build so he could test it and he started to ask for more features. In the end, there was MASSIVE feature creep I wasn't willing to do. On his end, he was supposed to be marketing the plugin/company since he claimed to have an engaged following and knew marketing related skills. I should have seen a red flag when he had about 3k followers but extremely low engagement (averaging ~10 likes a post!). 

To this day, I think of him as a massive conman with empty promises and quite the attitude. I told him I wasn't going to work on the plugin anymore until I got paid and he tried to guilt trip me. "You don't care about the vision" etc etc. He has no drive, no following, and can't even stick to his own word. He has claimed to be working on a big project to release 365 songs in a year and has pushed the date multiple times. Just a bunch of empty promises to his "fans". As of Feb 23 2024, he has released 15 tracks and started Sept 1 2023. 

De-SPITE all this, I wanted to release the plugin for free!
